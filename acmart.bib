	a simulation phase. For the results of the simulation to be meaningful,
	it is important that the model on which is based the simulator matches
	as closely as possible the reality. In this paper we present the
	simulation results of a straightforward algorithm using several popular
	simulators (OPNET Modeler, NS-2, GloMoSim). The results tend to show
	that significant divergences exist between the simulators. This can
	be explained partly by the mismatching of the modelisation of each
	simulator and also by the different levels of detail provided to
	implement and configure the simulated scenarios.},

	scenarios. The routing protocols used in this study include AODV,
	DSR, OLSR, OSPFv2 and ZRP, which comprise a good mix of reactive,
	proactive and hybrid protocols. The paper evaluates these protocols
	under simulation scenarios based on an actual exercise carried out
	under the DARPA PCS communications program. Mobility of the nodes
	was simulated using GPS logs from the field exercise. Traffic is
	simulated using a model of the traffic generation tool that drove
	traffic in the live exercise, and reads the same script files. The
	simulation results produced by QualNet are first validated against
	the corresponding measurements taken from the exercise, and several
	network configuration parameters are then varied to examine the performance
	of these protocols under "what-if" scenarios. This simulation study
	together with its post analysis shows the performance of each protocol
	under specific conditions both quantitatively and qualitatively.},
